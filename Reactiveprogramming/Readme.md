1. Functional programming = functional composition + lazy evaluation

2. Reactive programming = Functional programming ++ Immutability higher order funcions

3. Normal functions 
- we may pass object to a function 
- we may create object in a function
- We may return objects from a function

4. Functional programming
 - We may pass function to a function
 - We may create function in a function 
 - We may return function from a function
