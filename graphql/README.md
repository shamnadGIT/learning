Install npm
Setup babel dependencies.
Babel is a JavaScript compiler
Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Here are the main things Babel can do for you:
    Transform syntax
    Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through a third-party polyfill such as core-js)
    Source code transformations (codemods)
    And more! (check out these videos for inspiration) ->https://babeljs.io/videos.html
